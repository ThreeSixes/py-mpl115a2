Py-MPL115A2 is a Python 3 driver for the Freescale MPL115A2 barometer. It requires the quick2Wire library (https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-python-api), and requires that the i2c-dev kernel module be loaded.

This was originally developed as part of the OpenWeatherStn preojct. (https://github.com/ThreeSixes/OpenWeatherStn)
